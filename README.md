A Tic Tac toe game in Go.

This is simple desktop game called Tic Tac Toe (X and O) in which 2 players play.

Each player gets a mark (eighter X or O ) which can be choosed by preference.

The rules say that X has to go first and 0 will go second.

The outcome of the game is that eighter one of the players will win or else it will be a tie/draw.

Good luck!

I hope you enjoy this game.
